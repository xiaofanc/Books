A sequential search is 𝑂(𝑛) for ordered and unordered lists.

A binary search of an ordered list is 𝑂(log𝑛) in the worst case.

Hash tables can provide constant time searching.

A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are 𝑂(𝑛^2) algorithms.

A shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting incremental sublists. It falls between 𝑂(𝑛) and 𝑂(𝑛^2).

A merge sort is 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛), but requires additional space for the merging process.

A quick sort is 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛), but may degrade to 𝑂(𝑛^2) if the split points are not near the middle of the list. It does not require additional space.
