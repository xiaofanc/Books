"""
A classic example of an optimization problem involves making change using the fewest coins. 

Letâ€™s start with identifying the base case. If we are trying to make change for the same amount as the value of one of our coins, the answer is easy, one coin.

If the amount does not match we have several options. What we want is the minimum of a penny plus the number of coins needed to make change for the original amount minus a penny, or a nickel plus the number of coins needed to make change for the original amount minus five cents, or a dime plus the number of coins needed to make change for the original amount minus ten cents, and so on.

# Our dynamic programming solution is going to start with making change for one cent and systematically work its way up to the amount of change we require.
