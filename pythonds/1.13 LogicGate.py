"""
Inheritance is the ability for one class to be related to another class in much the same way that people can be related to one another. Children inherit characteristics from their parents (IS-A Relationship). Similarly, Python child classes can inherit characteristic data and behavior from a parent class. These classes are often referred to as subclasses and superclasses.
